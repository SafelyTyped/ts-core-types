# Core Safe Types for TypeScript

## Introduction

This TypeScript library gives you a set of core safe types to build upon.

## Quick Start

```
# run this from your Terminal
npm install @safelytyped/core-types
```

```typescript
// add this import to your Typescript code
import { Value } from "@safelytyped/core-types"
```

__VS Code users:__ once you've added a single import anywhere in your project, you'll then be able to auto-import anything else that this library exports.
